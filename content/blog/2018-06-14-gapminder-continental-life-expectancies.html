<p>Here we take a look at countries with low life expectancy across continents.</p>
<!--display settings and libraries-->
<pre class="r"><code>gapm &lt;- gapminder

  arrange(continent, year, lifeExp)</code></pre>

<div id="type-of-graph" class="section level3">
<h3>Type of Graph</h3>
<p>This is a scatter plot with linear fit lines.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>The Data</h3>
<p>Life expectancy for many countries spanning the continents. Here we look at the life expectancy over time of the lower quartile of countries.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-audience" class="section level3">
<h3>The Audience</h3>
<p>Anyone might be interested in trends regarding life expectancy, so this could be targeted towards a general audience of readers who might click on a science article.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-im-trying-to-show" class="section level3">
<h3>What I’m Trying to Show</h3>
<p>The continents are quite separable in terms of trend and magnitudes.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-read-and-what-to-look-for" class="section level3">
<h3>How to read and what to look for</h3>
<p>The lines of best fit do not intersect at all.</p>
</div>
<div id="presentation-tips" class="section level3">
<h3>Presentation tips</h3>
<p>For time series data, it’s important to highlight differences over time. Here we can see that each trend is completely separate.</p>
</div>
<div id="variations-and-alternatives" class="section level3">
<h3>Variations and Alternatives</h3>
<p>Unlike before with the time series plot, this scatter plot has a range of data at each time point. An alternative here would be box plots, in fact, they would show a lot more information about each quartile in addition to the lower one, and may illustrate more interesting trends (it was not the challenge in this lab excersize, however).</p>
</div>
<div id="how-i-created-it" class="section level3">
<h3>How I created it</h3>
<p>I split colors by continent after cutting out the upper quartiles from the dataset. Then fitted another smooth line as a linear model in this instance as opposed to the smooth curve fit from the gdp example.</p>
</div>
