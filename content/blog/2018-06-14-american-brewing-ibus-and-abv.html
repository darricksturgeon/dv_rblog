<div id="type-of-graph" class="section level3">
<h3>Type of Graph</h3>
<p>This is a scatter plot.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-data" class="section level3">
<h3>The Data</h3>
<p>Alcohol content and bitterness rating of various U.S. beers. This is from a dataset hosted on kaggle.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-audience" class="section level3">
<h3>The Audience</h3>
<p>Someone with some interest in american craft beer, probably at least knows what some of the types are.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-im-trying-to-show" class="section level3">
<h3>What I’m Trying to Show</h3>
<p>bitterness and alcohol percentage are enough to cluster some types of beer.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-read-and-what-to-look-for" class="section level3">
<h3>How to read and what to look for</h3>
<p>Looking for trends of like colors, you can notice how many of them clump together.</p>
</div>
<div id="presentation-tips" class="section level3">
<h3>Presentation tips</h3>
<p>It is better in these cases to do the extra work if possible. Fitting a GMM to this data could give some interesting results. The next challenge is plotting level sets of the gaussian distributions, which I don’t yet know in R.</p>
</div>
<div id="variations-and-alternatives" class="section level3">
<h3>Variations and Alternatives</h3>
<p>bubble plots can give a third dimension to the data of a scatter plot by scaling individual points.</p>
<p>area scatter charts can reduce the amount of data plotted by grouping big clumps together, can be good for extremely large data sets.</p>
<p>A step above that is a heat map, which works well for large datasets, but can be trickier with multiple classes.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-i-created-it" class="section level3">
<h3>How I created it</h3>
<p>Simply plotting ABV vs IBU in a number of popular styles of beer. The results were not too intriguing. Unfortunately, the data itself is low dimensional and lacks any ratings or interesting features to compare against.</p>
</div>
