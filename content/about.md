## Darrick Sturgeon

### Work

I work full-time as a Senior Research Assistant in a Neuroimaging lab at OHSU, with an emphasis on image processing.  I oversee and advise on a number of tailored MRI processing pipelines on macaques, rodents, and both human adults and neonates.  In addition to image processing, I also assist with software and computational problems, such as designing secure ETL pipelines for medical research databases and implementing software for stastical/machine learning analyses on neuroimaging data.

### Education

I attended college at University of Oregon, where I earned a B.S. in Physics and Philosophy, spending two years as the President of the Philosophy Club, and one year as a Student Researcher in Biophysics/Fluorescent Microscopy.  I am currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at OHSU, focusing on Machine Learning applications in image processing.
