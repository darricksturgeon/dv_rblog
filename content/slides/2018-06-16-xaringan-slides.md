# Visualizing Clusters

We're working on Iris

# The Objective

The goal is to see if clustering methods can tell us anything about our data.  To do this, we will employ and visualize a Gaussian Mixture Model, as well as PCA.  

This process and visualization can be effective in cases where the data:

- has or is expected to have class splits/boundaries.

- consists of several continous observations/variables.

# Clustering

<!-- insert image -->

Generally, clustering falls under the purvue of unsupervised machine learning.  We want to see what 'natural' boundaries we can find to divide a dataset.  This may be because we do not know what to expect, or perhaps we hope it will line up with the true classes of the data.
